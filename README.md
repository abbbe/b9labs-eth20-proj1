You will create a smart contract named Splitter whereby:

* there are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol. [DONE]
* we can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the Web page. [DONE]
* whenever Alice sends ether to the contract, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol. [DONE]
* we can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the Web page. [DONE]
* Alice can use the Web page to split her ether. [DONE]

Stretch goals:

* add a kill switch to the whole contract. [DONE]
* make the contract a utility that can be used by David, Emma and anybody with an address to split Ether between any 2 other addresses of their own choice. [DONE]
* cover potentially bad input data. [DONE]
* Rebuild the Splitter instance state only based on events.

Do not:

* split between more than 2 people
